    <h1>Cyber Attacks and Digital Security</h1>

    <p>My project title was <strong>“Why do people become victims of cyber attacks?”</strong> I chose this topic because many Afghan girls now study and work online. After the restrictions on girls' education in Afghanistan, most opportunities moved to the internet. That means girls spend more time online, and they are more at risk of cyber attacks.</p>

    <h2>🔍 Research Methods:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Interviewed 3 girls in online classes.</li>
      <li>Created a Telegram survey with 28 participants.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📢 Key Findings from Interviews:</h2>
    <div class="highlight">One girl said her account was hacked before.</div>
    <p>All three said that online security is important, but they don’t have enough resources to learn about it. Only one of them used two-step verification.</p>

    <h2>📊 Telegram Survey Results:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🔐 71% use the same password for many accounts.</li>
      <li>🚫 64% don’t use antivirus on their phone or computer.</li>
      <li>📚 93% think schools should teach digital security.</li>
      <li>📡 22% use public Wi-Fi, which is not safe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>This project helped me understand how digital life is becoming more common, especially for Afghan girls. But many people don’t know how to protect themselves. I learned that we need more education about digital safety in our communities.</p>

    <div class="highlight">This experience was very useful for me, and I hope it helps others stay safe online too.</div>
